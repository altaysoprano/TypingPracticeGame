# Typing Practice Game

An application developed for users to gain typing practice on their phone and make it enjoyable, like a game.

The application uses Room, Coroutines, Dagger-Hilt, and some other libraries.

### Gameplay

In the game, the user is given 1 minute and then a countdown begins. As the user finishes each sentence, they earn extra time proportional to their speed and a score based on the number of errors and their time. This process is repeated for each sentence. The user has 3 chances to make a mistake in each sentence, and the game ends when they make the 4th mistake or when the time runs out. To increase their time and prevent it from running out, the user must be as fast and accurate as possible.
